### **01. Rewards & Tiers**

We have allocated a dedicated pool for this program. Rewards are distributed based on the severity of the vulnerability as classified by the Fluxion team.

| **Severity** | **Description** | **Reward (USDT + MNT)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **High** | Critical logic bugs, potential loss of funds, or severe manipulation of liquidity pools. | **$1,000 - $2,500** |
| **Medium** | Unauthorized access to non-critical functions, oracle price deviations, or logic errors. | **$300 - $1,000** |
| **Low** | Minor contract vulnerabilities, front-end security risks, or information leaks. | **Up to $300** |

### **02. Scope**

The bounty program primarily focuses on the following areas:

  • **Smart Contracts:** Core v2/v3 liquidity pool logic, swap mechanisms, and concentrated liquidity modules.
  
  • **Protocol Security:** Re-entrancy, flash loan resistance, and mathematical boundary conditions.
  
  • **Network Infrastructure:** Cross-chain communication protocols and consensus layer stability.
